    <h1> Review of State Websites</h1>
    <h2> Alabama</h2>

    <p>Overall, Alabama’s website was very pleasing to the eye and easy to navigate. The main color; navy, was a great choice because it popped without having too much going on. The font of the website was also a nice addition because it was simple, yet pleasing to the eye. The website loaded incredibly quickly and I had no problems with it being too slow. Right away it comes out with good information such as who their governor is, COVID-19 information, and a search bar with popular searching terms. Navigating the website was easy, it has a nice section with pull down tabs. It had a government section, online services, business, and residents tab. These all had subcategories under them which led to helpful information for almost any question or problem a person could have. I also liked how when you would shrink the screen size, the website would modify to that size instead of having to slide over on the screen to see the entire website. </p>

    <h3> Alaska</h3>

    <p> Alaska also had a nice website for their state. It was also a nice dark blue color with yellow accents and white wording. It was very pleasing to the eye. I also liked that they chose a nice, easy to read font. Alaska's website also loaded very quickly for me, and I had no issues with waiting for the website to load. I really enjoyed the menu for this website because under each of the tabs, it had sub categories to links of helpful places for residents, potential residents, along with road conditions, and other helpful information. Finding any information that you’re looking for is quite easy. The tabs are simply labeled and if anything is not in those tabs, you can go over to the search bar and type in what you’re looking for. This website differs from Alabamas in the fact that if you shrink the screen, it doesn’t fit to the screen that you’re using. A person would have to use the sliding tab to move the screen over. Overall, Alaska had a nice website, but its major downside was that it doesn’t fit its website to the screen size that a person is using. </p>

    <h4> Minnesota</h4>

    <p> Minnesota’s website looked different then Alaska’s and Alabama’s. It popped up quickly and at the top of it had a search bar and a “MN” with a Minnesota next to it. It also had a bar right under this with a COVID-19 portal so people seeking information on that could easily find it. It also had a dark blue theme to its website with green accents. However, right when the website popped up it had a nice fall leaf picture in the background. I thought this was a nice addition to the website to help celebrate the fall season. This website also loaded quickly for me. The menu was also easy to navigate on this website. The menu tab was in the top left corner. Once you clicked on it the tabs of residents, business, government, employment, education, and travel all were available to click on. The residents and government tab had a sub category which was nice. I like how the other websites had subcategories for all of the tabs, but this was still useful in navigating the website. Also at the bottom of the page there was an about tab, connect, and help tab, These all had many sub categories that were helpful to people trying to navigate not only the website but also the state of Minnesota. It wasn’t as easy to find the items I was looking for since there weren't many sub category tabs, but it was still not very hard to find any information that I was looking for. This website worked really well in multiple screen sizes. It would adapt and fit to the screen size that I was using. </p>

    <h5> Massechusetts</h5>

    <p> The Massachusetts website loaded for me right away. As soon as I got onto the website it immediately had an emergency alert tab that talked about the CoronaVirus. It had 3 sub tabs talking about the latest on cases, travel orders, and the phased reopening approach. This website also had a dark blue and white theme to its website. It used mostly white or black colored fonts, with easy to read fonts. I thought that this website was pleasing to the eye. Along with that, it also had a picture of a Massachusetts skyline that was very beautiful. The menu for this website was located in the upper right hand corner. Once it was clicked on, it had different tabs of living, working, learning, visiting & exploring, your government, and COVID-19. These all had many different sub categories which made it easy to locate what a person would be looking for; such as under working it had business resources, taxes or finding a job. This website contained a lot of good information for not only residents but travelers as well. The Massachusetts website adapts to the screen size of the user. This makes the website not only easy to navigate, but also even more pleasing to the eye. </p>

    <h6> New Hampshire</h6>

    <p> Right away when the New Hampshire website loaded, it was not as eye pleasing to me as the other states. It had a blue and yellow theme to it. Along with a New Hampshire state crest in both the top right and left corners. They also had a picture of a wooden bridge that is located in New Hampshire. I thought this was a nice addition, however, I didn’t think that the overall layout and design of this website was very pleasing. I thought that the creators could’ve spent more time making it look more sophisticated. They also had a COVID-19 information banner at the top of the screen. The menu for this website was located at the top of the page horizontally. It had many different tabs including home, business, residents, visiots, government, online services, and careers. All of the tabs except for home and career had sub categories. These seemed to be incredibly helpful for anyone seeking information about these topics. The website also had boxes on the homepage that included education, travel and tourism, laws and rules, weather, traffic, and even the state almanac. This website did not scale to fit the size of the screen of the users, which is another downfall to their website. </p>

    <h7>Ranking the websites'</h7>

    <p> My favorite website was Alabama's because it was pleasing to the eye, easy to navigate, and also fit to any screenn size. My seconf facorite was Minnesota's. I thought it looked great and was able to be navigated easily. Coming in third would be Massachusetts because of it's beautiful colors and many different tabs to help navigate the website. Alaska was my fourth favorite because it was also easy to navigate and had a lot of useful information. My least favorite was New Hampshire because I personally didn't like the look of the website and also didn't like the layout of it.</p>
