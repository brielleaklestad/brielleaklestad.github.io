        <h1> Website Review</h1>

        <h2> Glacier National Park</h2>


        <p> The first website I chose as a “good” website was the website for Glacier National Park. I really liked how right away there was a big red banner that had COVID-19 updates. Although I'm sure people are tired of seeing this, it's good to keep the public informed on the location's policies. I really enjoyed their choice of pictures, I think that it depicted Glacier well. This website was full of information. It had everything from the weather, to things to do in the park, history of the park, and just lots of good information that is helpful to the person navigating the website. I did dislike that they mostly had only black as their color. Although it looks nice and sleek, they could’ve incorporated another color to add a little more pizazz to the page. I think that adding these colors could've also helped incorporate colors seen thorughout the park. They had many different tabs and menus that would lead a person to get the information they wanted. They did use HTML elements. I saw many div and script elements. They also used javascript throughout the code. The layout did make sense to me and there is a scrolling effect.They have a menu in the top right, many different buttons that lead to information, and tabs at the bottom along with a search bar. The colors that this site used were black, and then hints of blue, green and orange to go along with the National Park label. I think that these colors were effective because they do match the label so they have a flowing theme throughout. This website was easy to navigate because everything was laid out well and labeled in an effective way. The little things that set this site apart are its cool icons and pictures. It also has a webcam of the park on its page which is very cool! Each of these are incredibly unique to the park and add to the page because it makes it more personalized to glaciers. Overall this was a fantastic website. If a person was wanting any information at all on Glacier National Park, it would answer all of their questions. This website had tons of information, a great choice and variety of pictures, and lots of contact information for potential visitors. </p>

        <h3> Carlos Bakery</h3>

        <p> The second website that I labeled as “good” was Carlos Bakery Website. This website is the bakery from the show “Cake Boss.” It is a bakery ran by Buddy Valastro and his family. I liked this website overall because they did a good job of displaying their products by not only pictures but also describing them well in the descriptions. I dislike how right away on the website it says “goldbelly.” I think that could be because of a host website they’re using but I think that it takes away from the rest of the page. Their code also looks new and modern. It uses many html elements that we also use in class. Since it's a huge website, it obviously has a very long code. The layout to this website does make sense to me. It has many different menu tabs up top on the website that lead to different informational pages, and it also has many different buttons that say “order now” or “learn more.” I think these buttons make quick links to the pages that a person is looking for and it's a good addition to the website. I find it easy to navigate around this website. I could scroll up and down the entire page and each of the linked pages without a problem.It is pretty self explanatory to find what you’re looking for and if you can’t then you can just type it into the search bar. There are two major colors to this website and they are maroon and white. I think that these are nice looking colors, and I also know that they have always been these colors even dated back to when Buddy’s dad owned the bakery so it’s tradition thing for the family. However, since their products are cakes and cupcakes and many of their pictures are bright colors, a brighter color scheme might match it better. What sets them apart is that they not only have information about their products, but also an entire tab/page dedicated to information about the bakery and Buddy himself. They also have some “gifs” on their page which are moving pictures. Overall, this website was great. It had lots of information about their products, and was easy to navigate. I liked how they included many pictures of their products to show potential buyers what they're getting. This is a great overall website and was also put together well.</p>

        <h4> Irish Wrecks</h4>

        <p> The website that I chose to describe as bad is called Irish Wrecks online. It’s just an overall terrible website. What sets this website apart from the others is that it just looks absolutely terrible. The links on their pages don’t even work except for one of them. The color scheme is terrible, nothing on the page really matches.The background color isn't very attractive and it is one of the first things that I noticed. The pictures and logos that they chose to use don't look very good either and aren't of good quality. There are tables. The coding looks very simple, however, it did have some of the HTML element that we have been using. It doesn’t look like the website creator spent very much time creating this page. It also shows the CSS page and there wasn't much to it which a person could tell just from looking at the website. One good thing it has going for it is that when you shrink the page or open it on a smaller device it fits to the size of your screen. This page is easy to navigate because there isn’t much to it and when you try to go somewhere it doesn’t work, so it really can’t be hard to navigate. The layout doesn’t make sense to me because it isn’t an attractive looking page at all. You couldn't really scroll because of the lack of information on the page.It is also difficult to go anywhere on the page for information since it doesn't have much. Overall the website isn't very attractive or informative. Many of the links do not work, and the overall theme of the page is all over the place and not fluid throughout. I would not rate this website very high.</p>
