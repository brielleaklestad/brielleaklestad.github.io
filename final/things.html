                <p> For visitors looking for things to do both in and on the water, Flathead Lake offers countless fishing and boating opportunities. Visitors interested in fishing in Flathead Lake will enjoy finding some prime fishing spots off the lake towns of Somers and Big Fork, or by Sportsmans Bridge. Anglers will appreciate the abundant trout fishing activities offered at Flathead Lake. Those interested in excellent trout fishing will have good luck trolling the deep waters of the lake. During the spawning season, they can visit the shallow bays of Flathead Lake with excellent results.
                    For those not interested in fishing but still looking for Flathead Lake activities on the water, recreational inflatable boats, inflatable kayaks, and paddleboards do well along the shore. Arrowhead RV Park and Marina, Bigfork Marina and Boat Center, Big Arm Lakeside Marina, and Marina Cay Resort all have boat rentals, plus boating supplies you can rent for the day. You can also visit these Flathead Lake boat rental companies to rent some recreational water toys like kayaks or paddleboards. The pristine waters of Flathead Lake make it an ideal spot for in-water activities. Flathead Lake waters are among the cleanest and clearest in the world. Along the southern shore, Salish Point, located in the small city of Polson, offers an ideal open-water swimming area. Families will enjoy the roped off, contained swimming spot. Along with that visitors can also participate in hiking or horseback riding.</p>
