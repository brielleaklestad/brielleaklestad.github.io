            <p> Many parts of the world have four different seasons in a year. These are Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter. The weather for each of these is diffrent. As the weather changes, plants and animals change too so that they can adapt to their surroundings. A season is a division of the year marked by changes in weather, ecology, and the amount of daylight. On Earth, seasons are the result of Earth's orbit around the Sun and Earth's axial tilt relative to the ecliptic plane. In temperate and polar regions, the seasons are marked by changes in the intensity of sunlight that reaches the Earth's surface, variations of which may cause animals to undergo hibernation or to migrate, and plants to be dormant. Various cultures define the number and nature of seasons based on regional variations.</p>
